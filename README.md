Wikipedia of the Future: The Awe-Inspiring Artist

Welcome to the Age of Openness, or the Steam Ages

You're creative, inspiring, and sometimes a bit too abstract for us to understand - but, hey, that's our loss.

 

In your future, the internet will feel like a garden - you'll tend to your online existence, and creativity will flourish. There will be collaboration, openness, and oh, so much joy.

 

Wikipedia is still the go-to place for learning in your future, but it can now be accessed in person: in public spaces, through augmented reality, and you get to experience people's memories through physical touchpoints. A bit complicated, but we're sure the engineers will figure it out![my wikipedia future](https://github.com/Viktoria12345678910/Viktoria12345678910/blob/main/Wikipedia%20of%20the%20Future_%20The%20Awe-Inspiring%20Artist.png)
